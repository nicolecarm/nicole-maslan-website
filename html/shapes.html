  <h1>AI tells a Story</h1>

  <p>
    While working with the <a href="http://narrative.ict.usc.edu/">Narrative Group</a> at The Insitute for Creative Technologies at USC, I helped create Triangle-COPA, a development test set for the formalization of commonsense psychology.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Triangle-COPA
  </h3>

  <p>
    Humans are constantly creating stories to explain what other people are thinking, feeling, or why they are doing what they do. In fact, this is something we are quite skilled at. The video below is one example of how we can easily narrate the movements of even simple shapes.

  <p>
    Inspired by an experiment done by two social psychologists, Heider & Simmel (1944), the Narrative Lab produced the <a href="https://hsit.ict.usc.edu/">Heider-Simmel Interactive Theater</a>. Using this tool, anyone can create short videos in the style of Heider & Simmel's original experiment.
  </p>

  <p>
    While working with the Narrative Lab, I used the Heider-Simmel Interactive Theater to craft a test set to develop an AI's commonsense knowledge.

  <h3>
    First-order Logic
  </h3>

  <p>
    While working on this project, I created 100 questions inspired from clips similar to the one shown above. These questions were designed to elicit the fundamental commonsense reasoning we do effortlessly on a daily basis and pose a challenge to an AI's core reasoning capabilites.
  </p>

  <p>
    To create this test set, I began by writing out questions in the natural language we use on a daily basis.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the questions above are a piece of cake for us to understand, we have to implement sophisticated natural language processing pipelines for an AI to "get it". To mitigate undue these undo complexities I then wrote out each of the 100 questions in conjunctions of first-order logic literals - much more akin to the language an AI understands.
  </p>

  <p>
     I ended up using 122 predicates, as shown below, which we segmented into categories including character actions, temporal and spatial relations, and mental actions.
  </p>

  <p>
     As people, we can never know or keep track of every detail in our life. Our ability to interpret, or create storie, about our world is a critical part of our survival. Through the process of describing narratives in natural language and then first-order logic I developed a much deeper appreciation for the intricacies of our ability to tell stories.

  <h3>
    Presenting my Work
  </h3>

  <p>
    One of my favorite parts of this project was presenting my work to others. Not only did I get to present my work to the ICT community but 
    I also had the opportunity to co-author <a href="http://people.ict.usc.edu/~gordon/publications/AAAI-WS15.PDF">papers</a> and attend conferences. </br> </br>

    From this experience, I learned how to contextualize my work in relevant and exciting ways to people of different backgrounds and experiences.
