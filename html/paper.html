  <h1>The Creative Process</h1>
  <p>
    While working at the Claremont College's <a href="https://creativity.claremont.edu/">Sontag Center for Collaboration and Creativity</a>, also known as The Hive, I dove into design thinking and strengthened my creative muscles. I co-led a workshop on <a href="https://creativity.claremont.edu/event/designing-your-life/">"Designing your Life"</a> and took a semester long course in Human-Centered Design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since working at The Hive, I have stretched my creativity in new ways, learning how to build websites, record and edit muisic with DAWs, and create vector images using graphic design software.
