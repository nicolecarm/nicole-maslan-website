  <h1>Linguistic Conventions</h1>

  <p>
    While working in <a href="https://cocolab.stanford.edu/">Stanford's Computation and Cognition Lab</a>, I researched how people name something they have never seen before. The video below documents the game I built using node.JS, CSS, HTML, and GitHub.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Experimental Design
  </h3>

  <p>
    The main focus of this project was to better understand how names are conventionalized through dialogue. A study by Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) offered a great experimental design for examinig this conventialization process. In their experiment they had a pair of participants play the roles of "matcher" and "director" and coordinate a grid of ambiguous tangram shapes, as shown below.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the experiment, the "matcher" and "director" sat across a table from each other, seperated by a screen 
  </p>

  <p>
    As thorough as their experiment was, since they did their experiment in person they collected a data from a small set of participants, which created difficulties for examining the processes at work in great detail.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a solution to this, I set about digitalizing their experiment using web development frameworks. This would enable me to collect data from many participants quickly and to easily analyze their dialogue with modern natural language processing tools.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Multi-player Web Application in Real Time
  </h3>

  <p>
    I modified an existing code base used by the CoCo lab to study references. The overall Node.js framework remained the same but I added a chat panel and workspace where players could drag objects around and watch their partner do so in real time. The GitHub repository for the tangrams replication game can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/hawkrobe/tangrams_replication">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    An example of the final rendering of the game is shown below.

  <h3>
    Gathering Data
  </h3>

  <p>
    I recruited twenty-four pairs of participants using Amazon's Mechanical Turk  crowd-sourcing service. For each round of the game played, I collected a wide array of data including successful matches, text files of their dialogue, and time stamps for a variety of actions completed during the game.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Data Analysis
  </h3>

  <p>
    The core of my analysis revolved around measuring how well the co-occurance of a given word used to describe a given tangram at the start of the game predicted the words that were consistently used to describe the tangram in the final round of the game, where the tangram's name could be considered conventionalized.
  </p>

  <p>
    My first step working with the data involved hand-coding the utterance used to describe each tangram. After doing this, I measured the co-occurence value of a word by calculating its pointwise mutual information (PMI) value. To compute this, I essentially counted the frequency that a given word x occured when speaking about tangram y and then counted the global frequency of the given word x used to describe all tangrams in that round.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Results
  </h3>

  <p>
    My analysis revealed that words with high PMI values in round 1 are more likely to remain in round 6 than words chosen at random in round 1. This suggests that a word with a high co-occurance value in round 1 may be a core reason why that word sticks around and gets conventialized later on.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the grid of tangrams shown in the image and video above displays, there were 12 tangrams for the participants to describe. In order to keep track of what name went with which tangram, they may have used the uniqueness of a word to a certain shape as a fast and low-cost way to coordinate on what tangram was being referenced. 
  </p>

  <h3>
    No "right" or "wrong" name
  </h3>

  <p>
    Throughout all the data I looked at, pairs of participants had a wide variety of names that were conventialized for the same shapes. Two examples of this for tangram 'C' and 'G' are shown below.
  </p>

  <img id="tangram-C" src="../images/ghost-tangram.png" alt="image and conventionalized names for tangram C"/>

  <p>
    Some examples of how participants described tangram C were 'angel', 'ghost', 'floating dude', 'singer', 'arms up', and 'falling person'.
  </p>

  <img id="tangram-G" src="../images/seal-tangram.png" alt="image and conventionialized names for tangram G"/>

  <p>
    Examples of descriptions for tangram G included 'seal', 'rock rolling into ditch', 'yoga person', weird one', and 'praying mantis'.
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples like these provide evidence that the conventioalization process can lead to a variety of different phrases. The co-occurance theory supports this, suggesting that conventialization has a level of arbitrariness to it, but that there are also patterns, such as co-occurance, which can describe the conventionalization process despite a wide variety of different phrases.
