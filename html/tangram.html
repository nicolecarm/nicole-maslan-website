  <h1>Linguistic Conventions</h1>

  <p>
    While working in <a href="https://cocolab.stanford.edu/">Stanford's Computation and Cognition Lab</a>, I researched how people name something they have never seen before. The video below documents the game I built using node.JS, CSS, HTML, and GitHub.

    Crafting the experiment
  </h3>

  <p>
    The main focus of this project was to better understand how names are conventionalized through dialogue. A study by Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) offered a great experimental design for examinig this conventialization process yet had a limited data set, which created difficulties for examining the processes at work in detail.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a solution to this, I set about digitalizing their experiment using web development frameworks. This would enable me to collect data from many participants quickly and to easily analyze their dialogue with modern natural language processing tools.
